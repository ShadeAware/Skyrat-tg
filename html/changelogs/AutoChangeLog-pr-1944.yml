changes: 
  - tweak: "M90 sprite is now a proper top-loaded carbine with a grenade launcher, and not a flat-out P90. Inspired by the old design. Grenade mode includes one of those fancy distance measuring sights!"
  - tweak: "C20r sprite is no longer squashed, and uses the sprite from Eris. Included a cool yellow holosight. The toy version of it also has a foamy grip instead of polymer."
  - tweak: "Detective standard revolver replaced with a modified rendition of Blade Runner's LAPD revolver."
  - tweak: "Detective alternate revolver sprites updated to modern (aesthetic overhaul) standards. Except uh, the leopard one. Does anyone actually use it?"
