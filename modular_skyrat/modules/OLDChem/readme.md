## Title: OLDChem

MODULE ID: OLDCHEM

### Description:

Ports the more important OldChem chemicals to the new base, because Cobbychem is shit and nobody FUCKING likes it.

### TG Proc Changes:

- "Multiver" has been renamed to Charcoal and had its lung damage stripped out.
- borghydro.dm now uses old chemicals instead of the Cobbychem fuck-shit.
- rot.dm now only needs 1u Formaldehyde OR Preservahyde to preserve a body, like how it was on the old server.
